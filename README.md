+ ### <font size=5> what will i mention in this 'report'?</font>
<font size=4>Explain the main function and aim of the files by talking about the input, output and a little bit more about process</font>

+ ### <font size=5>A brief summary of current work</font>
<font size=4>Those files are just libraries for self-defined functions. There are ten files in total, but i haven't went through all of them. I only have a look at 'py' files but no '.ipynb' files. So only '.py' files will be covered in the report.
</font>

><font size=4>_Here is a flowchart shwoing the aim for each '.py' file_ </font>
